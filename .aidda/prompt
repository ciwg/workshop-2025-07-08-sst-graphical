contrast with simpler event/state model

I wonder if Mark has some things backwards and that is resulting in
more complexity than necessary.  I think a more elegant
model would be simply that nodes are states and edges are
events.  For example:

nodes:
- nodes represent event, things, or concepts? why don't edges
  represent events, and nodes represent states?
- a thing is a state of matter -- why isn't that simply a state node?
- a concept is, fundamentally, also a state of matter in a brain or
  other storage. that, too, can simply be a state node

edges:
- nearness is a state -- why isn't NEAR a state? 
- a causual sequence is a sequence of events connecting states -- right?
- CONTAINS is a state -- why isn't that a node? 
- EXPRESSES is a state -- why isn't that a node?
