split slides

Replace the slides in README.md with a two-part remark.js slide deck
that covers:

- part 1: the contents of analysis.md
- part 2: the contents of alternative.md

Split the slides into smaller slides; no slide should be longer than
about 10 lines.

Each slide should be a series of bullet points, not a paragraph.

Sysmsg: 
  Wrap lines at 70 characters. Do not rewrap lines unless they are
  longer than 70 characters. Do not rewrap markdown header lines.
